## Introduction:

This project, Cat Burgers, is a lighthearted website intended to be an exploration of building a full functioning site from the back to the front. The website offers the ability to create a new burger, feed it to the cats, make another, or throw it away. The burgers are all stored in a ClearDB database, and once the database information is returned, the site is rendered via express-handlebars.
